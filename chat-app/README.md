# Chat App

1. Server and client must be from the `chat-app` directory.
2. Run the client with `sbt "~appJS/fastOptJS"` to keep the client files up to date with the changes you make to `js (appJS)` project.
3. TODO: Figure out how to run the server from command line. `sbt runMain com.rtjvm.chat.backend.Server` or `sbt run` does not launch the server. For now, you should be able to run it from IntelliJ.
4. Chat application should be accessible at http://localhost:8080/static/index.html
